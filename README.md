# Gestor de Base de Datos H2
### by Jesus Cueva
<br>
This program is about having a fully functional UI which allows the user to interact with the H2 Database without having to write the needed sqls. 
The program is user friendly, I tried to make it as easy and intuitive as possible. Each time you'll just need to fill in the required fields and hit 
the button and the program we'll do the rest. 
It allows you to do the whole CRUD on the database, including triggers, saved processes, and much more. <br>
